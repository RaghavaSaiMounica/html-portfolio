<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Mounica. I was working as a consultant in India , recently shifted to Berlin.
  Currently I am learning web development as there are limited job opportunities here for Non-German speaking people.
  So I am here , learning the course</p>

<p>I love travelling,exploring new places,making new friends and trying new food.
  I started cooking a couple of years ago and I found it interesting.
  My hobbies are cooking, reading books and watching shows </p>

<p>I love animals , specially cats. I am a cat person. I have adopted two cats and one of them went missing so currently I have one.
  I love him a lot and miss him. Since I moved to Berlin I couldnt get him along with me , he is currently with my parents.
  I cant wait to meet him.</p>
